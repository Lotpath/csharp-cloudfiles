# Rackspace Cloud Files CSharp API

### DEPRECATED
This library is no longer maintained, and there will not be any future enhancements or bug fixes.
### Do not use for new development.

But all is not lost! It is being rewritten [here](https://github.com/rackspace/openstack.net/), which will support Cloud Servers, Cloud Files, and the rest of the Rackspace Cloud.

Look [here](https://github.com/rackspace/openstack.net/wiki/Feature-Support) for the current list of implemented features.
